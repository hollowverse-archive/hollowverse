# Hollowverse - Design Directory

#### Main Idea
- Everything in this directory is pre-alpha state. Things like fonts, spacing, colors, icons are all placeholders. The purpose of the mockups is to give at least a legible visual idea of what we're doing while building up components. All Photoshop source files are included for easy on-boarding of prospective designers.

#### Directory Structure
```
└───DesignDocuments
    ├───<TopicName>
    │   ├───_ideas
    │   └───_outputs
    └───<AnotherTopicName>
        ├───_ideas
        └───_outputs
```

#### Information & Usage

- Each design topic has a separate directory which contains multiple .PSD files which reflect the current status of the respective work. Let's treat these .PSD files as **read-only** because overwriting them may corrupt the work due to people using different Photoshop versions and different color profiles for their monitors.
- Each design topic contains a directory named `_ideas`. Feel free to push PNG/JPEG/SVG or Markdown files to share your opinions, screenshots of design examples, inspirations etc.
- Each design topic also contains a directory named `_output`. These directories only contain PNG/JPEG/SVG files reflecting developer friendly versions of the design work. They are reproducible, so you can do anything you want with them including overwriting them with your graphic notes, doodles using a basic image editor like GIMP, PAINT etc.


#### Todos
- [x] Prepare a breakpoint guideline. (later to be seeded with actual layouts.)
- [ ] Wireframe the alpha version of Profile page. (mobile layout.)
