Hollowverse is a website that focuses on the profound ideas of influential individuals.

What you see today on [Hollowverse.com](https://hollowverse.com) is the legacy website that was built years ago using a simple WordPress CMS and editorial content. We are rebuilding the website using a newer technology stack and a user-generated content model.

To learn more about the new Hollowverse product, see our [Product Description](https://github.com/hollowverse/hollowverse/wiki/Home) wiki page.

## Technology choices

The project is powered by a JavaScript/TypeScript stack running on Amazon Web Services. We use Node.js, Express, and SQL for the back-end. React and its ecosystem tools for the front-end.
